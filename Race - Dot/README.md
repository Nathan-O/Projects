Hello, and welcome to this little game. The goal is simple and straight forward; all you have to do is get your dot around the course before your determined combatant can cross the finish line.

How do you do this?

Well...

If you so happen to call yourself Player 1, do as follows:

	Using keys 'l' and 'p' tap repeatedly 
	to move the player token toward the 
	finishline.

And Player 2, this is what you do:

	Using keys 'a' and 'w' tap repeatedly
	to move the player token toward the 
	finishline.

Result:

Joy & fun!

Very little bruising.

In truth I have no idea how to sructure a README document, and I suppose the program itself is limited enough that I don't need to explain much. This was mainly a learning expierience for me. The program is ratehr iffy and full of bugs that I know are there:
		
		keys don't need taping, you can just hold them down.

		issues with elements being leyer wrong in the display (player tokens behind road).

		feels very flimpsy all together.

On and on. But this was fun, and challenging enough at times that I had to set realistic expectations after a certain point. Given more time I would try to add more elements not only to the game but to the look and feel as a  whole (Balance colors and flow of display, debug display, add my own event alert instead of using the system default, calibrate corners more solidly, fix to avoid certain issues with tokens being off lane, etc...).

Enjoy.
